#GIS 501 - Lab 3 Question 3

#This code takes all the words "Science" and replaces them with "Systems".

import os,sys    #Imports the operating system

infile = open("F:\\GradSchool\\MSGT_GIS_501\\Labs\\Lab_3\\Data_L3\\GIS_is_the_best.txt\\", "r")    #Accesses and reads the file

outfile = open("F:\\GradSchool\\MSGT_GIS_501\\Labs\\Lab_3\\Data_L3\\GIS_is_the_best.txt\\", 'w')    #Accesses and writes file

replacements = {"Science":"System"}    #Chooses which words to change

for line in infile:    #Identifies file to look at and goes line by line

        outfile.write(line.replace("Science", "Systems"))    #Gives the replace command

infile.close()    #Closes file with errors in it

outfile.close()    #Closes file with corrections made
