#GIS 501 - Lab 3 Question 1

#This code was supposed to take all the files that were upper case and make them lowercase as well as add "file_" at the fromt of each one.

import os,sys    #Imports systems for the code to draw from

os.listdir("F:\\GradSchool\\MSGT_GIS_501\\Labs\\Lab_3\\Data_L3\\text_files\\")    #Takes the list from designated directory

files = ("F:\\GradSchool\\MSGT_GIS_501\\Labs\\Lab_3\\Data_L3\\text_files\\")    #Labels files as a path for later in the code

for root, dirs, files in os.walk("F:\\GradSchool\\MSGT_GIS_501\\Labs\\Lab_3\\Data_L3\\text_files\\"):    #Goes through designated file

    for fil in files:    #Telling program to look for specific files to work with within text_files

        fil = fil.lower()    #Makes filenames lowercase

        filsec = fil.split(".")    #Splits all the files whenever a "." is seen

        if filsec == "txt":    #Tells program that if it's a text file then just add "file_" to the front

            os.rename("F:\\GradSchool\\MSGT_GIS_501\\Labs\\Lab_3\\Data_L3\\text_files\\" + fil, "file_" + fil + ".txt")    #Renames .txt files with "file_" at the beginning

        else:    #If the file is not a .txt file, then..

            os.rename("F:\\GradSchool\\MSGT_GIS_501\\Labs\\Lab_3\\Data_L3\\text_files\\" + fil, "file_" + filsec + ".txt")    #Changes non .txt into .txt and adds "file_" to the beginning

#       Without their help I would have been lost since I wasn't trained as a computer programmer and have zero coding experience.
