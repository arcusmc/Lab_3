#GIS 501 - Lab 3 Question 2

#This code counts the total number of words in the provided .txt document.

Lab_3_Q2 = open("F:\\GradSchool\\MSGT_GIS_501\\Labs\\Lab_3\\Data_L3\\GIS_is_the_best.txt")    #Opens required .txt file

file_list = Lab_3_Q2.read()    #Reads the designated .txt file

system_count, science_count, total_words = 0, 0, 0    #Required parts to be counted and initial values

for word in file_list.split(" "):    #Splits pathname and returns a tuple that has path and filename
    
    if word.lower() == "systems":    

            system_count = system_count + 1    #Counts the words "system" and "System"

    elif word.lower() == "science":

            science_count = science_count + 1    #Counts the words "science" and "Science"
    else:
            total_words = total_words + 1    #Counts all words besides systems and science

total_words = total_words + science_count + system_count    #Basic formula for adding all the words together

print "'system' occurences = " + str(system_count)    #Total occurences of the word system 

print "'science' occurences = " + str(science_count)   #Total occurences of the word science    

print "Total words = " + str(total_words)   #Calculates the total number of words
